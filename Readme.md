# Pso2 swiki timezone converter

Add an extra line above the emergency event table in pso2.swiki and pso2m.swiki.

It depends on local time, so make sure your local time is correct (especially daylight saving).

It will also show local timezone as UTC +/- N in the first cell and current time in the last cell.
Please double check the time after first installed.

Only tested in U.S. CA, but it should also work in any other timezone.
